# Spotify-Watch

A repository for automated retrieval and processing of spotify data

To adapt this repository to retrieve your own discover-weekly data you only need to
* Replace the discover-weekly `playlist_id` in `pipeline_inputs.yaml` with your own
* Add your `SPOTIFY_ID` and `SPOTIFY_SECRET` as environment variables through the repository's secrets
